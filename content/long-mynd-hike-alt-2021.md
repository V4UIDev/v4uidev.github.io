# Introduction

The 2020 Long Mynd Hike got cancelled due to COVID Lockdown, so an alternative route was offered by Tim Parker (known colloquially as Dr. Tim) in September 2020. A 50 mile route comprising the Offa's Dyke path, Glyndwr's Way and the Kerry ridgeway. The route started anywhere, but I believe those who did (myself and Iain included) started in Bishop's Castle, in a clockwise route.
<br><br>
Myself and Iain Prentice would go to do this route in March 2021.
<br><br>
I always wanted to do the Long Mynd Hike after marshalling on the 2017 edition, so this would be a good way to try out the distance. It would not be until 2024 that I got to actually do the proper event, due to clashes or other long distance events around the same time.
<br><br>
The reason we chose a clockwise route is that the route is very undulating for the first 60-70%, and it is pretty flat or downhill along the Kerry Ridgeway. For our attempt, we decided that early Spring would be ideal, enough to have a big chunk of the run done during the day, and hopefully the weather would be on our side.

## Preparation

In terms of preparation for the route itself, there was a study of the route for places to refill bottles, shops etc. To this sense, there was not many streams, and due to being on agricultural land not really drinkable unless you have filter tablets. We did pass quite early on through Knighton, which did have a shop available to us, but apart from that there was not many places to get supplies enroute.
<br><br>
Iain and I did chat about the day out itself, we both wanted just to get around in a decent time, taking however long it would take us. We managed to have maps between us to cover the whole route, meaning we were okay navigation wise. Logistically, we did not want support due to the limitations of lockdown, being a commitment for support crew etc. and that also made it more of a challenge. Luckily for our start point, Bishop's Castle, parking is free and ample, our choice being the cattle market.
<br><br>
I had previously done a [12 hour ultra](https://jaredforte.com/abraham-tea-round/) route with only one support point in 2020, so I had some limited experience. I had also built a good fitness base with the spare time on my hands during Lockdown.

## The day itself
Iain picked me up quite early, as we aimed for a sunrise start, with the start being about 40 minutes drive away from Ludlow. It was a cold start, but not raining luckily. We set off promptly, chatting away as we made way towards the Offa's Dyke path. The climb up was pretty big but we just took it steady. Once we got up high, we noticed some of the hills had snow on them as we made our way towards Knighton. This section had alot of steep climbs and descents, so we were able to keep quite warm as we made our way there.
<br><br>
We then arrived in Knighton, opting to stop at the shop. My choice was a Bottle of Lucozade and some snacks, and I believe Iain went for some fruit. I was glad to get some electrolytes in, which I think helped stopping me from cramping on the hills. We then made our way out of town on the Glyndwr's Way, despite being less steep, there was still the undulating, but with more sections on road. We then got quite high for a long time as we passed over Beacon Hill, which was quite barren but had to be careful as there was loads of frogspawn at this time of year!
<br><br>
It was then down to Felindre and then back up, before we hit the transitionary road to the Kerry ridgeway. From memory, I believe this was a point where we refilled water bottles, but I may be mistaken. The sun then set as we started on the Kerry ridgeway. At this point I was getting pretty sore, with chafing setting in a little bit. Luckily, due to the flat terrain it was easy to break into jogging at points interspersed with walking breaks. The navigation was especially a key factor at this stage, as most of the day we had been following trail markers, and it had been daylight. It was also quite high up (around 400m) meaning that as it got later the temperature started to drop.
<br><br>
We both got on with it, having big highs and lows as we did. We soon reached a woodblock, which I was grateful for as the wind was also picking up and bringing in a chill. However, when we got to a not very clear junction, we chose a wrong turning. We dropped back down towards Churchtown, rather than following the road back into Bishop's Castle. I was very annoyed at this, as I knew it would be extra climbing and distance, but just took it on the chin and we adapted for a route back up and over to Bishop's Castle.
<br><br>
When we got to Bishop's Castle, I was elated. My first 50 mile route done. However, it was then I noticed how bad the chafing situation had become as I got changed, very painful!
<br><br>
Overall, it was a great route, and good to do something only a handful of people had a go at. I was also very grateful for Iain getting me through my first 50 miler with his wealth of experience from other ultras. The Long Mynd Hike itself is also a good event, and I will eventually write up about my experience on that.
