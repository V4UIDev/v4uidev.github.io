Hello! My name is Jared. I currently work as a Systems Administrator where I work with various types of technology, mostly Linux and hardware.
<br><br>

<img src="/images/me.jpg" class="float-right" style="max-width: 20%;">

My hobbies include:
<br><br>

- Running, where I compete in fell running and ultramarathons, I do occassionally dabble in road running.
- Amateur Radio, which I currently hold a Full Licence, my callsign being G5JFJ. I have a youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@g5jfj-sota) where I occassionally post videos.
- Climbing and general mountaineering, I hope one day to scale some big summits!
<br><br>
I am a member of the G-QRP club and Telford and District Amateur Radio Society, both clubs have very interesting technical talks/projects which I sometimes get involved in, that I highly recommend looking into if you are looking for technical challenges.
<br><br>
If you are into running and live near Shropshire or Wales, I highly recommend both Mercia Fell Runners and the Welsh Fell Runners' Association, both groups organise very good races that are low key, challenging and friendly.
